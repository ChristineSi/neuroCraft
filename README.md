Simplifying the lifes of neurodivergent learners.

## Overview
NeuroCraft aims to create a model to classify texts regarding their easiness for dyslexia readers. After testing different models, we decied to use a [RoBEETa model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roberta). The model is trained on the [CLEAR (CommonLit Ease of Readability) Corpus](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfsZhhP2umXXtmEP_NRErxLuwgN98TyH7LWOq3j07O0/edit?ref=commonlit.org), an open dataset of 5,000 excerpts for students from grades 3 to 12 in English Language Arts classrooms. The texts will be simplified through a Language Model (LLM).
