Already the successful first editionreceived high praise and it seems to be a some-what unrewarding task to (re-)review a bookthat has been labelled as ‘(...) well-thought-out textbook (...) invaluable for students whowant to know more than the basic elementsof acoustic phonetics’ (P.

However,this second edition contains a new chapter onspeech perception and additional sectionson digital filtering and cross-linguistic voweland consonant perception. Thus, the presentreview sets out to give a brief sketch of thebook’s contents and its didactical techniqueswith special attention to the newly addedtopics. Written for students in linguistic phonet- ics, in speech and hearing science, as wellas in branches of electrical engineering andcognitive psychology dealing with speech,the book offers a nontechnical introductionto the acoustic theory of speech production,to acoustic properties of major classes ofspeech sounds, and to the auditory represen-tation and perception of speech.

These semi-related stuff boxes informally address digressive questionsof students, ranging from underwater speechto the aerodynamics of freeways, connectingacoustic terms and perceptual phenomena toeveryday experience. One can highly agreewith the author ‘that some of the most interest-ing stuff in the book is in the boxes’ (p. 2).

      "Keith Johnson Acoustic and Auditory Phonetics; 2nd ed. Blackwell, Oxford 2003 192 pp.; £ 17.99 ISBN 1–405–10123–7 This volume is a revised and expanded (second) edition of a textbook first publishedin 1997. Already the successful first editionreceived high praise and it seems to be a some-what unrewarding task to (re-)review a bookthat has been labelled as ‘(...) well-thought-out textbook (...) invaluable for students whowant to know more than the basic elementsof acoustic phonetics’ (P. Ladefoged), ‘the bestphonetics textbook I’ve ever used’ (J. Pierre-humbert), and ‘an excellent phonetics text forstudents of linguistic phonetics and speechscience’ (C.A. Fowler) [all citations takenfrom the back cover of the book]. However,this second edition contains a new chapter onspeech perception and additional sectionson digital filtering and cross-linguistic voweland consonant perception. Thus, the presentreview sets out to give a brief sketch of thebook’s contents and its didactical techniqueswith special attention to the newly addedtopics. Written for students in linguistic phonet- ics, in speech and hearing science, as wellas in branches of electrical engineering andcognitive psychology dealing with speech,the book offers a nontechnical introductionto the acoustic theory of speech production,to acoustic properties of major classes ofspeech sounds, and to the auditory represen-tation and perception of speech.\n",

      "These topicsare conveyed in a lucid, sometimes almostcolloquial style, which reflects the author’steaching experience and his awareness of thestudents’ difficulties in grasping abstract con-cepts of acoustic and perceptual phonetics.The great didactic value of the textbook underreview is enhanced by a lot of grey-shadowedboxes dealing with ‘semi-related stuff’ (asthe author puts it). These semi-related stuff boxes informally address digressive questionsof students, ranging from underwater speechto the aerodynamics of freeways, connectingacoustic terms and perceptual phenomena toeveryday experience. One can highly agreewith the author ‘that some of the most interest-ing stuff in the book is in the boxes’ (p. 2). Before going to the description and dis- cussion of the various chapters there are twogeneral positive remarks to be made whichapply to the textbook as a whole. First, theauthor does not only deal with acoustic andauditory phonetics in different chapters, he also successfully combines these two aspectsof speech sounds throughout the book, thusdemonstrating that the linguistic significanceof speech acoustics greatly depends on theauditory systems of human beings. Second,despite the highly technical foundation ofacoustics the author refrains from introducingtoo many formulas although ‘the really inter-esting part of acoustic phonetics starts whenyou get out a calculator’ (p. 2).\n",

      "Even in dis-cussing several analysis techniques of digitalsound processing (p. 28ff.) he succeeds inreducing mathematics to practical instructionswithout loss of (phonetically relevant) infor-mation. The volume under review is subdivided into nine chapters, followed by references(pp. 168–173), answers to selected short-answer questions (pp. 174–178) and an index(pp. 179–182). Each chapter is completed byexercises, consisting of a paragraph of ‘suffi-cient jargon’ (i.e. a list of technical terms dealtwith in the preceding text) and of a series ofshort-answer questions. Unfortunately, not allof these questions are answered in the appen-dix mentioned above. Otherwise the exercisescould have met the requirements of a text-book for an autodidactic study of the field.By the way, there is a typographical error inthe answer section concerning the formula forantiformant frequency (p. 178); the numeratorof the formula should read ‘(2 ×1 – 1)c’ 56Libri DOI: 10.1159/000078663\n"
