Entrepreneurs have been trying to ﬁt the square peg of their unique problems into the round hole of general management for decades. As a result, many entrepreneurs take a “just do it” aRtude, avoiding all forms of management, process, and discipline. Unfortunately, this approach leads to chaos more oHen than it does to success.
